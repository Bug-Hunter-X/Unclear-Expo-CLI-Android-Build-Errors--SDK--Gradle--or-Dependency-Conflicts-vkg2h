The solution involves a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Verify Android SDK Setup:** Ensure you have the correct Android SDK installed and configured. Check your `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable.
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Run `expo prebuild` to clean the Android build, and then try again using `expo build:android`. 
3. **Update Gradle:** Check for Gradle updates, it is possible to need update `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`  file
4. **Dependency Management:** Carefully review your dependencies for conflicts. If you're using a library that manages splash screens (like `react-native-splash-screen`), try removing it and using Expo's built-in splash screen functionality. A clean installation might be required to properly remove the library.

**Example (bugSolution.js):**

```javascript
// ... (Your Expo project setup) ...

// Remove conflicting library (if applicable):
//  Remove from package.json
//  yarn install || npm install

// Use Expo's splash screen functionality (if needed):
// ... configure Expo's splash screen according to the documentation...

expo build:android --release  // Use release mode for production
```
