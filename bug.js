This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The error message is often cryptic and might mention issues with the Android build system, Gradle, or a missing dependency.  However, the root cause is sometimes related to incorrect or outdated Android SDK configurations, or mismatched versions of Expo modules and dependencies.  Example of a problematic dependency: `react-native-splash-screen` can conflict with Expo's splash screen mechanism if not properly configured or removed.
